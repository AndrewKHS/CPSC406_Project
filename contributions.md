●We made a project that uses Word2vec to get the position of the vector of the words in the database and find the midpoint between those two vectors. Our project is that the big database we planned was not downloaded to the computer, so we used a database with only basic words. Our database has fewer words, so the midpoint word usually is the Start Keyword or Finish Keyword that is close to the midpoint (this means there is no middle word between the two words in the database). That does not mean our project is not working.

Example. Start Keyword "nuclear" and Finish Keyword "war". Result is "war"


●If you put the Start Keyword as “uncle” and the Finish Keyword as “fish”, you will get a "sheep" page. That means that the closest page to the median vector value of “uncle” and “fish” is the “sheep” page.
Also, if you put the Start Keyword as “uncle” and the Finish Key Keyword as “chicken”, you will get a “girlfriend” page.

More examples. Order below is "Start page" and "End page" = "mid page"

“uncle” and “whale” = “aunt”,

“friend” and “fish” = “farmer”,

“mantis” and “dragonfly” = “kumquat”,

“candle” and “squid” = “petal” etc..

●If you put a word that is not in the database, it shows an error message and does not display the page. For example, the Start Keyword as “polar bear” and Finish Keyword as “fish”.
